In simpler terms, the client-server model refers to when there are two computers communicating, and one of those computers is the client, and the other is the server.

## The Request and Response Cycle
The client-server model is a fundamental model for network communication. It describes how two computers communicate over a network. The client initiates a request and the server responds to that request appropriately. This cycle repeats itself as long as the connection between the two computers remains active. The client-server model is used by most modern network protocols, such as HTTP. It is also the basis for most modern applications, such as web browsers and email clients.

## What is the Client?
A client is a computer that initiates a request to a server. The client usually needs some information or resource from the server. In most cases, the client is a software application, such as a web browser or email client. The client sends a request to the server and then waits for a response.

## What is the Server?
A server is a computer that responds to requests from a client. The server provides the resources or information that the client needs. The server receives requests from clients and then sends responses back to them. Servers are often located on remote computers, which means that they are accessed over a network.
