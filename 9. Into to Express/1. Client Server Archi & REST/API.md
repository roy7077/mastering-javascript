# API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. They are used to enable the integration of different software systems and facilitate communication between them.

## 1 APIs on the Internet:
<ins> Web APIs (or Web Services): </ins> These are APIs that allow different software applications to communicate over the web. They use standard web protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS. Common types of web APIs include RESTful APIs and SOAP APIs. Web APIs are used for various purposes, such as fetching data from a server, sending data to a server, or performing specific actions.

<ins> Examples: </ins> The Twitter API, Google Maps API, and GitHub API are examples of web APIs on the internet. Developers can use these APIs to access Twitter data, embed maps in their applications, or interact with GitHub repositories programmatically.

## 2 Downloaded APIs (Libraries or SDKs):
<ins> Software Libraries or SDKs (Software Development Kits): </ins> These are sets of tools, routines, and protocols for building software applications. They often include pre-written code and guidelines to help developers integrate certain functionalities into their applications. When you download and use a library or SDK, you are essentially using an API provided by that software component.

<ins> Examples: </ins> TensorFlow and scikit-learn are machine learning libraries in Python that provide APIs for developers to build machine learning models. Similarly, Android SDK provides APIs for developing Android applications.

In summary, APIs on the internet (web APIs) enable communication between different web services, while downloaded APIs (libraries or SDKs) provide a set of tools and functions for developers to use within their applications. Both types of APIs play a crucial role in software development by promoting interoperability and code reuse.
